# Ramulator V2.0a in 2024 Winter URP
## 
Ramulator 2.0 is a modern, modular, and extensible cycle-accurate DRAM simulator. It is the successor of Ramulator 1.0, achieving both fast simulation speed and ease of extension. The goal of Ramulator 2.0 is to enable rapid and agile implementation and evaluation of design changes in the memory controller and DRAM to meet the increasing research effort in improving the performance, security, and reliability of memory systems. Ramulator 2.0 abstracts and models key components in a DRAM-based memory system and their interactions into shared interfaces and independent implementations, enabling easy modification and extension of the modeled functions of the memory controller and DRAM. (If you want more details, check Ramulator V2.0 Repository by CMU-SAFARI)

This Github repository contains some parts of ramulator 2.0, which have been modified during the project. Because of the size of files, we didn't committed the results of simulations and cputraces. You can check modified source code in src folder.
